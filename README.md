# Personal Portfolio

## Description

- I wanted to create a portfolio that displayed a consolidated "project page" where future clients could see the quality of work I can provide 
- This personal portfolio will allow potential clients and/or companies to read a brief description about me, view clickable links to my past projects, and contact me from a single web page.
